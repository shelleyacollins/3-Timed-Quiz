Still do not yet understand basic principles. Information settles slowly, therefore I am currently spending 40+ hours outside of class watching videos, tutorials, and studying. Mostly I go back and forth between resources, change my code, change it again, rinse and repeat. I am still a work in progress!.. however, I do not expect to pass this homework assignment. I will continue to seek answers until this assignment is complete and correct.
